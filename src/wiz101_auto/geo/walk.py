"""Collision geometry math for collision-based teleporting.

Goal: teleport as *close to the target as possible while guaranteeing the spot is
walkable*. We take the real walkable navmesh (the actual triangle faces, not a convex
hull), carve out the wall footprints dilated by the player's clearance, and pick the
point of that region nearest the target. Because the result is on the navmesh and a
clear radius from every wall, the body can't clip — a single, decisive teleport.

(The earlier version hulled the mesh — ~2.3x too big, so it placed teleports in
non-walkable courtyards — and eroded that inflated area by the player radius, which
closed narrow corridors and flung points far from the target. Both are fixed here.)

The lower-level cube/transform helpers (toCubeVertices, transformCube, toMultidim)
come from PeechezNCreem / CIick and are shared with the shape builders below.

# from ~ground level upward, so this catches them (including ones whose modeled base
# floats a little above the navmesh, e.g. WC Triton's central cylinder sits ~4u high),
# while overhead structures the player walks *under* (domes, arches, upper-floor walls
# — bases 75–270u up) are correctly ignored. A full body-height band over-blocks those
# and throws teleports wildly past them; a foot-only point slice misses the floating-
# base walls and clips. ~50u of upward slack threads that needle.
#
# A real wall always rises *above* the feet (high zmax), so it's caught regardless of
# how far down the band reaches; the only thing Z_BAND_DOWN includes is colliders whose
# TOP is below the feet — sub-floor foundation/water volumes (e.g. GH MainHub's dock
# cylinders, r~447 at z ending ~13u under the surface). Too much downward slack lets one
# of those wipe out the walkable dock around it and throw a teleport hundreds of units
# off. Keep it small — just enough for a wall whose base is modeled a hair below the
# navmesh — so genuinely-underfoot geometry is ignored.
Z_BAND_UP = 50.0

# When a collider's base is at or *below* the feet, the feet are inside the volume. That
# alone can't mean "blocked": every solid in collision.bcd is flagged identically
# (`CT_Object`), and coarse *terrain* volumes — e.g. GH HFjord's rocky floor or Ravenwood's
# ground, modelled as r~500 OBJECT cylinders the walkable navmesh sits *inside* — carry the
# same flag as real walls. Blocking on flag/size is impossible; the only separator is how far
# the solid rises ABOVE the feet, i.e. whether the player's body capsule fits. This is a
# physical height check, but the player ("PlayerObject", tid 1) has NO collision file, so the
# capsule height isn't readable from game data — it's a calibrated constant bounded by in-game
# behaviour:
#   walkable (terrain you stand inside): GH dock +22/+34u, Ravenwood ground +55u
#   blocks (real wall/chamber/trunk):    WC Drains chamber +94u, Celestia +288u, Bartleby +250u,
#                                        Drains building box +730u
# The navmesh only ever sits inside a collider for these big terrain/building volumes (a normal
# wall has navmesh *beside* it, caught by the horizontal footprint), so the gap between terrain
# (<=55u) and structures (>=94u) is wide and stable. 75u sits between: it frees GH + Ravenwood
# while every genuine wall still blocks (Celestia 208u/z=-350, GH 87u, AZ 223u unchanged; Drains
# lands 340u out, still well outside its building box — vs the old, more conservative 510u).
#
# BUT rise alone can't separate every case: Khrysalis KR_Z00_Hub's flat UniverseTeleport pad is a
# BOX rising only +52u above the floor (navmesh at the box's base) that genuinely bounces, while
# Ravenwood's walkable terrain CYLINDER rises +55u — nearly identical rise, opposite verdict. The
# tie-breaker is the proxy shape: across every zone examined the must-NOT-block volumes are
# CYLINDERS/SPHERES (coarse terrain the navmesh threads through) and BOXES are always structural
# (pads/walls/buildings). So a BOX the navmesh is *embedded* in walls off at a much smaller rise
# (`Z_BOX_TOL`) — only a box the navmesh sits on *top* of, rise ~0, is walkable.

        ``strict`` drops the ``prefer_z`` shell exemption described below, so every covering
        volume is honoured as a wall. That is *too* strict for general use — the exemption is
        load-bearing for a large share of walkable ground (a scan of nine zones found ~5400
        sampled surfaces that are only teleport-valid because of it, including whole zone

        walkable level *closest to the goal's height* — i.e. the floor the goal is actually
        standing on. This is what disambiguates stacked multi-level XYs: an upper-floor target
        (high ``prefer_z``) keeps the upper surface even when ground-floor navmesh sits at the
        same XY hundreds of units below, and vice-versa. (The earlier directional min/max pick
        collapsed to the wrong floor whenever the target's own surface rounded a hair onto the
        wrong side of ``prefer_z`` — a 1u boundary error that dropped teleports a whole floor.)

        A collider whose vertical band *contains* ``prefer_z`` is treated as NOT walling off
        this floor: the target is a real, reachable game position sitting inside that volume, so
        it's a coarse structural/terrain shell the body occupies (a tower's bounding BOX, a
        terrain cylinder), not a wall — otherwise the whole floor inside it reads as blocked.
